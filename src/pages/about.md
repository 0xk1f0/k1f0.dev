Welcome to my corner of the internet! I'm Fabian.
By day, I'm a programmer who loves solving logical puzzles and building cool things.

When I need a break from the screen, I swap my keyboard for a medical bag as a volunteer EMT-B.
It's a great way to give back, connect with people, and keep myself grounded in the real world.

Feel free to poke around my site, check out my projects, or reach out if you want to chat about code or EMS!
