After many what seems to be useless days and hours of protesting, Reddit still seems to not care about their userbase.

The day of the announced [API Price Changes](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit/comments/12qwagm/an_update_regarding_reddits_api/), which will lead to the end of many [third party apps](https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/13ws4w3had_a_call_with_reddit_to_discuss_pricing_bad/)
is coming closer and closer.

## About the "Blackout"

When I saw the first announcements of subreddits going dark, I knew this could only work if a broad majority of big subs participated, with **_no fixed ETA when they will come back online_**.

This of course was not the case for many of the subreddits that participated in the protest. Many of them only went dark for a day or two, which is [exactly what the CEO hoped for](https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/13/23759559/reddit-internal-memo-api-pricing-changes-steve-huffman).
I know it's a pretty steep task to basically shut down a sub that has many users and a lot of content that is accessed and used by a lot of people everyday. But exactly that would actually
hurt Reddit's revenues in the long term, which would be ideal.

As long as there is traffic to the actual websites, which also means ads will be served, Reddit wont be moving even an inch from their current greedy state.

## What I noticed

Most of the subs i browse are either Programming or Linux related. These subs contain a large amount of useful information, as I found myself googling for things and be redirected to a common
Linux Subreddit, only to find out it's currently set to private. The ArchWiki served as a reasonable alternative for a while but when it comes to more specific issues or things that are not directly
Linux related, Reddit is always my final option.
It really would be a shame if all this information and good content is gone. But the responsible company for hosting it is unfortunately pissing of a lot of people, including me.

I mean, it's not the userbase's fault that Reddit is not able to develop a good Mobile Application that is actually useable..

## Until they break

Here are some good third party reddit clients:

- [Infinity](https://github.com/Docile-Alligator/Infinity-For-Reddit) (Android)
- [Apollo](https://apolloapp.io/) (IOS)
- [RedReader](https://github.com/QuantumBadger/RedReader) (Android)

Use them while you still can.
