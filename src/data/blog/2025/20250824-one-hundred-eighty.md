A lot of time has passed again since the last time you heard from me here.

So I thought it would be a good opportunity to give a little update on how things are going on my side currently.

## We're back in IT!

Since the beginning of June, I am officially employed in the IT sector as a Software Engineer again. It certainly was a hard-switch for me (hence the title of this blog post), coming from nine months of community service at the Austrian Red Cross in emergency services. It took some time getting used to, but I am really glad to be working alongside some amazing and knowledgable people, at a company I know and love. We're building some really cool stuff currently, which I can't really tell you about, but I am looking forward to the coming weeks and months, to see where things go.

## Finding the balance

I knew that I would not be able to completely drop the whole medical thing, since working in emergency services certainly changed me and somehow made me addicted. This is why I decided to voluntarely work for the Austrian Red Cross in the first place, which I also announced in [my previous post]("https://k1f0.dev/blog/back-at-last"). But what I did not know back then, is what sort of impact it would have on my primary job and life. I can now confidently say, that it turned into one of the best "hobbies" to get away from the whole IT stuff, back to working in real-life, helping people in need. Although I don't really want to frame it as a "hobby", because even if you're working as a volunteer, the same responsibilites for every "Rettungssanitäter (RS)" still apply to you. Which is why I do and always will carry out this voluntary work with great care and respect, and I try to still learn medical stuff as much as I can in my free time, so I can be the best RS in every mission thrown at me.

## What's next

In all honesty, I really want to start doing more blog-posts again where I just talk about stuff. Since I kind of found my flow again, these posts will primarly be based around programming stuff, but I guess we will see where things go. FWIW I started some personal coding projects again, one of which I might be ready to share with the public soon (not really useful to everyone, but I think the whole creation process is interesting, which is why I want to blog about it). No ETA for that yet, but you'll hear from me soon.
